        <h2> OIL SPILLS</h2>
        <hr>
        <p title="Abstract">Oil spills threaten millions of miles of coastline, river systems, lakes, and terrestrial habitat daily,
        particularly where extensive oil drilling, refining, and transport take place. The challenge of managing oil
        spills around the world is increasing in complexity and magnitude. Oil spills from the tankers provide
        examples of the adverse impacts of large amounts of oil on aquatic and coastline ecosystems. Those spills
        closest to shore generally have the greatest adverse effects on the environment since the oil would not have
        time to disperse before reaching shore and can significantly impact the sensitive habitats of a variety of
        organisms. The Exxon Valdez, the most recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and similar
        oil spill disasters illustrate the dangers of oil exploration and transportation. Oil spill prevention
        remains the only way to manage the transportation and exploration of this hazardous material, as no
        foolproof cleanup methods have been discovered.</p>
        <p>Oil spills are regrettably common around the world: the Amoco Cadiz in France in 1978; the Exxon Valdez in
        Alaska in 1989; the ‘Gulf War’ in Kuwait in 1991; the Erica in France in 1999; the Aegean Sea in Galicia, Spain, in
        1992; and the Prestige in Spain and France in 2002, which are some of the most well-known oil spills. Oil spills originate
        in oil platforms, refineries, or oil tankers that have an accident or that ‘clean’ their tanks in the ocean. The
        oil reaching the coast in this manner affects different ecosystems – open and protected sandy beaches, estuaries, and
        rocky shores – or remains in the water to be finally deposited on the sea bottom in deep or shallow waters.
        </p>
        <p>The damage caused by oil spills differ depending on the chemical composition of the oil, the area affected,
        and the cleaning activities applied. The organism affected by an oil spill will be more or less sensitive to the
        pollution, depending on its nature and life cycle. But apart from the organism directly affected by the spill, other
        organisms can be indirectly subject to impacts due to changes in community structure and coexistence interactions such as
        grazing, predation, and competition dynamics.</p>
